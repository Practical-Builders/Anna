## Problem Statement:
### Online shopping can be difficult for those who are visually impaired (like myself). 
### Although online shopping makes shopping easier for the visually impaired community through product descriptions 
### which can be read by screen readers, for example, figuring out what color something is can still be a challenge. 
### One reason is that a lot of retailers, especially those in the beauty and fashion industry, do not use normal color descriptions like pink, but instead use a color description like orchid. If someone does not know what color an orchid is, how would they know what color that blouse is?

### Problem statement: Color descriptions use names like "merlot" instead of "deep red," making online shopping difficult for visually impaired individuals.
### Why #1: Why are color descriptions using names like "merlot" or "bold" instead of descriptive terms like "deep red"?
### Because retailers want products to sound luxurious and evoke emotions/feelings associated with wearing them.
### Why #2: Why do retailers prioritize creating luxury/emotional associations over clear, descriptive color information?
### (a) They assume visually impaired customers don't care about colors or appearance at all
### (b) They believe evocative names differentiate their products and drive more sales to their primary target audience
### Why #3: Why do retailers assume visually impaired customers don't care about appearance, and why do they focus only on their primary (sighted) audience when naming colors?
### Stereotypes perpetuated by society and media suggest that visually impaired people don't care about appearance. 
### Retailers don't see accessibility as their responsibility and underestimate the market size (missing colorblind customers and others who benefit from clear descriptions).
### Why #4: Why don't retailers see accessibility as their responsibility, and why do these stereotypes about visually impaired people persist in product development?
### (a) Lack of awareness and advocacy leads to poor training in marketing/design departments on inclusive practices.
### (b) Visually impaired people are not included in user testing, product development, or represented in decision-making processes.
### Why #5: Why is there a lack of awareness, advocacy, and representation of visually impaired people in the e-commerce product development process?
### (a) Accessibility and inclusive design are not emphasized in marketing, design, and product development education.
### (b) Advocates are dismissed because companies falsely believe accessibility isn't financially worthwhile, missing that accessible design benefits everyone (like audiobooks, curb cuts, captions, etc.)
