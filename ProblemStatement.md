## Problem Statement:
### Online shopping can be difficult for those who are visually impaired (like myself). 
### Although online shopping makes shopping easier for the visually impaired community through product descriptions 
### which can be read by screen readers, for example, figuring out what color something is can still be a challenge. 
### One reason is that a lot of retailers, especially those in the beauty and fashion industry, do not use normal color descriptions like pink, but instead use a color description like orchid. If someone does not know what color an orchid is, how would they know what color that blouse is?

### Problem statement: Color descriptions use names like "merlot" instead of "deep red," making online shopping difficult for visually impaired individuals.
### Why #1: Why are color descriptions using names like "merlot" or "bold" instead of descriptive terms like "deep red"?
### Because retailers want products to sound luxurious and evoke emotions/feelings associated with wearing them.
