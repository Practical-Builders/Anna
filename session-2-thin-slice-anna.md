### Who is the user?
### Visually impaired and color blind online shoppers. 
### What is the problem?
### The problem is that retailers frequently use color descriptions that are ambiguous to those who cannot see them, making it difficult to identify what a product looks like
### One end‑to‑end user journey
### What’s explicitly out of scope
